Well, simmer down, there, Sparky, your adoring fans will have to hold out while you get a handle on the basics first. Little Wing wasn't built in a day, & neither will your next masterpiece.\n\nThe most important factors in playing music is knowing what chords & notes sound harmonious, & how to call them by name. This lesson aims to illuminate those skills & get you ready to jam out with other musicians. So grab that guitar, tune it up, & stick around a while - you'll be plucking your next hit soon enough!"

The horizontal lines represent the strings where - like Tablature - the fattest string is on the bottom of the diagram. The vertical lines are the fret markers, & the dots are where you place your finger & pluck. These are not chords, but are to be played one note after the other, in succession. Start with the left-most dot on the fattest string & play the three notes on that string, one after another. Then move to the next string & play those three notes, again starting from the left. Travel down the guitar until you finish the three notes on the skinny string, then play the whole thing in reverse until you end up back where you started.\n\nPay attention to the number above the first fret - it is a Fret Marker which indicates which fret that fret represents. If it's a zero, it means the dot is played open for that string.\n\nHooray! Now you know the Major Scale! If you use the Key Chord Finder above to display the chords in a particular Key, then any of the notes in the Major Scale of the same Key will sound great over those chords!\n\nThere are many other types of scales, including: Pentatonic, Minor, & Hexatonic - but for now we'll just focus on the most popular Major Scale."
